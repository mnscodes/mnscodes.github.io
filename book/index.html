	<p> Sensor Framework for IoT System-on-Chip</p>

	<p> <strong> About:</strong> With the advancement of portable devices and sensors, there has been a need to build a universal framework, which can serve as a nodal point to aggregate data from different kinds of devices and sensors. We propose a unified framework that will provide a robust set of guidelines for sensors with varied degree of complexities connected to common set of System-on-Chip (SoC). These will help to monitor, control and visualize real time data coming from different type of sensors connected to these SoCs. We have defined a set of APIs, which will help the sensors to register with the server. These APIs will be the standard to which the sensors will comply while streaming data when connected to the client platforms. </p>

	<p> Comparison Study of Different NoSQL and Cloud Paradigm for Better Data Storage Technology</p>

	<p> <strong> About:</strong> Advancements in web-based technology and the proliferation of sensors and mobile devices interacting with the internet have resulted in immense data management requirements. These data management activities include storage, processing, demand of high-performance read-write operations of big data. Large-scale and high-concurrency applications like SNS and search engines have appeared to be facing challenges in using the relational database to store and query dynamic user data. NoSQL and cloud computing has emerged as a paradigm that could meet these requirements. The available diversity of existing NoSQL and cloud computing solutions make it difficult to comprehend the domain and choose an appropriate solution for a specific business task. Therefore, this chapter reviews NoSQL and cloud-system-based solutions with the goal of providing a perspective in the field of data storage technology/algorithms, leveraging guidance to researchers and practitioners to select the best-fit data store, and identifying challenges and opportunities of the paradigm.</p>
