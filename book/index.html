	<p> Sensor Framework for IoT System-on-Chip</p>

	<p> <strong> About:</strong> With the advancement of portable devices and sensors, there has been a need to build a universal framework, which can serve as a nodal point to aggregate data from different kinds of devices and sensors. We propose a unified framework that will provide a robust set of guidelines for sensors with varied degree of complexities connected to common set of System-on-Chip (SoC). These will help to monitor, control and visualize real time data coming from different type of sensors connected to these SoCs. We have defined a set of APIs, which will help the sensors to register with the server. These APIs will be the standard to which the sensors will comply while streaming data when connected to the client platforms. </p>
